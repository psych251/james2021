# Replication Project Template

This is the repo for Madison Paron's replication project of james2021 for PSYCH 251. 

The template contains the replication project template as well as a file called `anonymize.py` that you can run to remove personally-identifiable information from the data exported by Qualtrics. Just run `python anonymize.py` to anonymize all Qualtrics `csv` files in the `data` directory.
