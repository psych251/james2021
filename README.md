# Replication Project Template

This is the repo for Madison Paron's replication project of james2021 for PSYCH 251. 

The template contains the replication project template as well as a file called `anonymize.py` that you can run to remove personally-identifiable information from the data exported by Qualtrics. Just run `python anonymize.py` to anonymize all Qualtrics `csv` files in the `data` directory.

Working story portion of experiment (images and sound files appear properly).

Need to implement sound check, instructions, IRB consent form, questionaires (age, lanugage, etc), and the 3 testing conditions.
